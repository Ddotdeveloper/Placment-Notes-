#### Learnings 
1. Static Member will not will considered while calc the size of the class 
2. Also, all functions (static and non-static both) do not contribute in size.
3. In case of Multiple Inheritance, constructors of base classes are always called in derivation order from left to right and Destructors are called in reverse order.

## Problem Set 2 : 
##### Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/output-of-c-program-set-2/?ref=lbp
#### Learnings : 
1. In [[Virtual inheritance]] a single instance of the base class is shared between the derived classes. This helps to avoid the "diamond problem" in multiple inheritance. for the 3rd Questions 
2. his kind of inheritance without virtual causes wastage of space and ambiguities. virtual base classes are used to save space and avoid ambiguities in such cases. in 2nd question size of 80 = 40 from b1 + 40 from b2 
3. I have to read about [[Conversion Constructer ]] read later after 5 problem set  for the first Question Video bhi dekh skte 
## Problem set 3 : 
#### Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/output-of-c-program-set-3/?ref=lbp
#### Learnings : 
if there is multilevel inheritance, then function is linearly searched up in the inheritance hierarchy until a matching function is found. matlab voh niche sai upar jata haii phle
